# how to build
- get the [Odin compiler](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) (builds are usually tested on the last official [release](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases))
- add Odin to `$PATH` enviroment variable
- (in cmd) use `build.bat` to build the game, or alternatively `build.bat run` to build and run the game  

# maps
#### Info for creating maps is in [DQM file spec](build/dqm_format_spec.md)  
Maps are a top-down, ascii view on the map, and different characters correspond to different
tiles - this means anyone can edit maps with just a simple text editor.  
`.dqm` file extension is used, even though the underlying file is just plain text.

> The raw tile table is in [tiles.odin](/doq/tiles/tiles.odin) as `Tile`

Some tiles are translated to different tiles when the map gets loaded into memory. For instance, lowercase
health pickup `h` is translated to `empty` tile, and the pickup itself gets spawned separately.

# dqmake
dqmake is a simple DQM map editor

[dqmake readme](/build/dqmake_readme.md)

> you can build dqmake just with `odin build dqmake.odin` command  
> use `odin build dqmake.odin -out:build/dqmake.exe` for releases  




# TODO
- better collision resolution!
- 3D audio
- simple profiler, maybe with [chrome://tracing](chrome://tracing)
- particles
